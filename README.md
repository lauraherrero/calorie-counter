# Calorie Tracker  🥪🍹🏋️‍♀️📈

## Summary: 📝

https://app-calories-tracker.netlify.app/

Project based on a calorie tracker.
The user has the possibility to add different activities, either food consumed or exercise performed.
When an activity is added, it appears in a separate list by category, showing the name and the kcal consumed.
In addition, it is possible to display a total counter of calories consumed from food and a counter of calories burned from exercise. Depending on whether we have a higher consumption of calories burned or consumed, the application will tell us if we are in caloric deficit or surplus.
The information is saved even if the page is reloaded and we can restart the application from scratch with the restart button.



## Technology Stack 💻
The application has been made from scratch with React using Vite and a custom hook that allows to separate the application logic and have cleaner components. We have also used useMemo that lets you cache the result of a calculation between re-renders.
